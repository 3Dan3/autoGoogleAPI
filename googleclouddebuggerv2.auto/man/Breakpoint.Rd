\item{condition}{Condition that triggers the breakpoint}

\item{expressions}{List of read-only expressions to evaluate at the breakpoint location}

\item{logMessageFormat}{Only relevant when action is `LOG`}

\item{logLevel}{Indicates the severity of the log}

\item{isFinalState}{When true, indicates that this is a final result and the breakpoint state will not change from here on}
