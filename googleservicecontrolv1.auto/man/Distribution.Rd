Distribution represents a frequency distribution of double-valued samplepoints. It contains the size of the population of sample points plusadditional optional information:  - the arithmetic mean of the samples  - the minimum and maximum of the samples  - the sum-squared-deviation of the samples, used to compute variance  - a histogram of the values of the sample points
